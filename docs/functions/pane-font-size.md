# Pane font size

Command palette entries (plus two default key bindings) to zoom the font size
of both file panes in and out on the fly, and to reset it back to the theme's
original size.

## Usage

1. Press **Alt+Up** to make the text in both panes larger, **Alt+Down** to
   make it smaller. Both panes always change together.
2. Open the command palette and search "font size" to run the same actions,
   plus **Reset font size** (palette-only, no default key binding).
3. The chosen size is remembered — it survives restarting fman.

This changes the **size** of the text, not the typeface. Which font
family the UI is drawn in is a separate, independent setting — see
[Select font](select-font.md) and [`docs/FONTS.md`](../FONTS.md).

This zooms the two file-list panes and the command palette. The
[text viewer](../views/TEXT_VIEWER.md#zoom)
has its own, independent zoom that reuses these same shortcuts (whatever
they're currently bound to) and adds matching palette entries scoped to the
viewer.

## Commands

| Command name               | Palette label      | Keywords                            | Default key binding |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `increase_pane_font_size`   | Increase font size  | zoom in, larger pane font, bigger    | `Alt+Up`             |
| `decrease_pane_font_size`   | Decrease font size  | zoom out, smaller pane font, smaller | `Alt+Down`           |
| `reset_pane_font_size`      | Reset font size     | default font size, reset zoom        | none (palette only)  |

The other words listed under *Keywords* are hidden search terms: they find
the command in the palette without ever being shown. See
[the command palette](../COMMAND_PALLETTE.md#hidden-search-keywords).

These can be rebound in `Key Bindings.json` like any other command, e.g.:

```json
{ "keys": ["Ctrl+0"], "command": "reset_pane_font_size" }
```

## Notes

- The font size is stored in `Core Settings.json` under the `pane_font_size`
  key. Running **Reset font size** removes that key entirely rather than
  writing back a hard-coded default.
- The two file-list panes and the command palette are affected — the status
  bar, location bar and column headers keep their own font size. The palette
  zooms by the same factor the icons do, so a pane zoomed one step larger
  opens a palette one step larger too; **Reset font size** puts it back.
- **Respects a custom theme.** If you have your own
  `Theme.css` (e.g. `%APPDATA%/fman/Plugins/User/Settings/Theme.css` on
  Windows) that sets a different base `font-size`, the first zoom press steps
  from *that* size, not from fman's built-in default. Resetting removes the
  override completely, so the pane goes back to rendering your theme exactly
  as authored.
- Font size is clamped between 6pt and 40pt; repeatedly zooming past either
  end has no further effect.
- **The icons zoom too.** Both panes' icons scale by the same proportion as
  the text, so `Alt+Up` zooms the whole file list rather than leaving small
  icons beside big text. They scale from whatever size *Set icon size* or the
  theme asks for — at `48`, zooming in grows them from 48 — and stop at
  fman's 12–64 range, so a long zoom stops the icons before it stops the
  text. **Reset font size** puts both back. See
  [Icons](../ICONS.md#it-follows-the-font-zoom).
- The zoom is **not** stored as an icon size of its own: it is derived from
  `pane_font_size`, so *Set icon size* keeps showing the size you picked.
- **The icon size also moves the row height**, so if the rows are taller than
  the font explains, that is where it comes from — see
  [Select icon set](select-icon-set.md). Unlike the font size, it is a theme
  property, not a `Core Settings.json` one.
- **`go_up` moved to Ctrl+Up on Windows and Linux.** Alt+Up was previously
  `go_up` (go to parent directory) on those two platforms. To free it for
  this feature, `go_up` is now bound to **Ctrl+Up** there instead. On Mac,
  `go_up` was already `Cmd+Up`, so nothing changed. `go_up` is still also
  available on **Backspace** on every platform.

## Implementation

- `src/main/resources/base/Plugins/Core/core/commands/pane_view.py` —
  `IncreasePaneFontSize`, `DecreasePaneFontSize`, `ResetPaneFontSize`
  (`DirectoryPaneCommand` subclasses), plus `InitPaneFontSize`
  (`DirectoryPaneListener`) which re-applies a saved size when fman starts
  (mirrors the existing `InitHiddenFilesFilter` pattern).
- **How the icons and the palette follow it:** the same three code paths call
  `_apply_zoom_scale`, which computes one plain factor — the current size over
  the theme's own — and hands it to both `fman.set_icon_scale` and
  `fman.set_palette_font_scale`. The engine multiplies its resolved icon size
  by it (`themes.scale_icon_size`), and `Theme.set_font_scale` multiplies every
  font size the palette draws: the item title, hint and description it paints
  by hand (`get_quicksearch_item_css`) plus a `Quicksearch QLineEdit`
  font-size rule appended last to the app stylesheet, which is what makes it
  beat the theme's own `.quicksearch-query` rule. Neither is saved, because
  `pane_font_size` already persists and is already re-applied on startup;
  saving it twice would give one zoom two homes that could disagree.
- The factor's baseline is captured by `_remember_base_pane_font_size`, once
  per session, **before** any override stylesheet is set. After that the view
  reports the override, so the theme's own size is no longer readable — which
  is why `InitPaneFontSize` records it unconditionally, even when there is no
  saved size to apply.
- The font is changed by setting a **widget-local QSS stylesheet** directly on
  each pane's file view: `FileListView { font-size: Npt; }`. This is applied
  via `pane._widget._file_view.setStyleSheet(...)`. A type-selector rule set
  locally on the widget beats both the app-wide `* { font-size }` rule from
  `Theme.css` and any user theme that also relies on that same `*` selector —
  so zooming works regardless of which theme is active.
- The starting size (before any zoom has ever been applied) is read directly
  off the live pane via `QFontInfo(view.font()).pointSize()`, so it reflects
  whatever theme is currently loaded rather than a hard-coded constant.
- `src/main/resources/base/Plugins/Core/Key Bindings.json` — the two default
  bindings above.
- `src/main/resources/base/Plugins/Core/Key Bindings (Windows).json` and
  `Key Bindings (Linux).json` — `go_up` rebound from `Alt+Up` to `Ctrl+Up`.
  `Key Bindings (Mac).json` was not touched (`go_up` was already `Cmd+Up`).
- **Why the platform files had to change too:** fman loads the base
  `Key Bindings.json` first, then the platform-specific file, and the
  platform file's bindings are checked *before* the base file's — first match
  wins (`Controller.handle_shortcut`, `controller.py:35-44`). So a base-file
  binding for a key a platform file already claims is silently shadowed on
  that platform; adding Alt+Up in the base file alone would not have worked
  on Windows/Linux.
- `src/main/resources/base/Plugins/Core/core/tests/test_font_size.py`
  — `ClampFontSizeTest` covers the pure step/clamp logic.
- The clamp logic (`clamp_font_size`, 6–40pt bounds) and the shortcut-lookup
  helpers (`get_shortcuts_for_command`, `format_shortcut_hint`) actually live
  in `core/font_size.py` and `core/key_bindings.py` respectively, imported by
  `core/commands/pane_view.py`, which aliases `clamp_font_size` back to
  `_clamp_font_size` so the moved bodies read as they always did. They were
  split out so the
  [text viewer's own zoom](../views/TEXT_VIEWER.md#zoom) could reuse them
  without a circular import (`core/commands/__init__.py` imports
  `core/textviewer.py` at module load, so the reverse import isn't possible).
- Likewise, `_get_saved_pane_font_size`/`_save_pane_font_size` are now thin
  wrappers over `core/settings.py`'s generic `get_setting`/`save_setting`
  (`json_name, key[, value]`) — extracted once the text viewer's own zoom
  needed the exact same "get/set one key in a JSON settings file, `None`
  clears it" pattern under a different key
  (`text_viewer_font_size` vs. `pane_font_size`).
