# Windows network drives

Opening a UNC path (`\\server\share`, or an RDP-redirected drive such as
`\\tsclient\C\...`) used to make the **whole window** unresponsive — both panes,
not just the one showing the share — and it stayed sluggish for as long as the
share was open. fman now keeps the UI responsive there and fills the listing in
far fewer network round trips.

## Why it was slow

On a local disk a file-attribute lookup costs microseconds. On a UNC or
RDP-redirected share every one is a network round trip (milliseconds to tens of
milliseconds). Three code paths multiplied that per file:

1. **Hidden-file filtering ran on the GUI thread and did its own I/O.** The
   default hidden-file filter called `QFileInfo(path).isHidden()`, which is
   uncached and does not go through fman's cached `stat`. The filter is invoked
   as `Model._accepts` from `RecordFiles._preprocess_existing` (up to three
   times per file) and from `SortFilterTableModel.update()` over every row —
   both reached through `@run_in_main_thread` methods. One blocking network call
   per file, on the thread that also paints both panes. That was the freeze.
2. **The background loader never gave up.** `Row.__eq__` ignores `is_loaded`,
   and a file whose `stat` fails yields the same empty Size/Modified cells as
   its unloaded placeholder — so `RecordFiles` saw no change and kept the row at
   `is_loaded = False`. `_load_remaining_files` re-submitted itself every 200 ms
   forever, re-issuing the failing calls and hopping into the GUI thread each
   time. This is what made the sluggishness permanent rather than a slow first
   load.
3. **One Windows shell icon lookup per file.** `.exe` and `.dll` icons are
   embedded in the file, so asking the shell for them reads the file over the
   wire. A folder like `platform-tools` is mostly such files.

## What fman does now

- **The hidden-file filter performs no I/O.** On Windows it reads
  `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN` from fman's own cached `stat`, which the model has
  already loaded to fill the Size and Modified columns — a cache hit, and it
  invalidates correctly with `fs.clear_cache(...)`. Behavior is unchanged:
  Windows hidden-ness is driven solely by the attribute (there is no dot-prefix
  rule there), so `.gitignore` stays visible and Git's hidden `.git` folder
  stays hidden. macOS and Linux keep using `QFileInfo.isHidden()`, which handles
  the dot-prefix and `UF_HIDDEN` rules.
- **A row that cannot be loaded is tried once**, not forever. An explicit
  reload (`Reload` / `Refresh`) retries it.
- **Files on a network path get a generic per-extension icon** — one shell
  lookup per extension instead of one per file, and nothing is read over the
  wire. Local paths are untouched.

## Getting real icons back on network drives

Run **Toggle network drive icons** (also listed as *Show real icons on network
drives*) from the command palette. It flips the setting, reloads both panes, and
persists across restarts. The setting lives in `Core Settings.json`:

```json
{
  "network_file_icons": true
}
```

Default is `false` (generic icons). Expect the slow, per-file behavior back on
high-latency shares while it is on.

## The network:// share list

Everything above is about `file://` UNC paths. The `network://` scheme — the
*Network...* entry in the drive list — is separate, and used to sit on an empty
pane for a long time with no sign that anything was happening. Three things
changed:

- **The browse-list walk no longer opens servers.** `NetworkFileSystem` only
  descends into containers (providers, domains/workgroups). It used to recurse
  into every resource it enumerated, so listing the root opened a connection to
  every discovered server — each unreachable one blocking for seconds — and
  then threw away everything that was not a direct child of the requested path.
  Shares are still listed: they are the direct children of the server handle one
  level down, so no share gets opened either.
- **Rows appear while the directory is still being enumerated.** The model used
  to drain `iterdir(...)` completely before committing a single row. It now
  flushes what it has every 0.5 s. A directory that lists faster than that never
  reaches the first flush, so local listings are unchanged.
- **A slow pane says so, and keeps saying it.** After 0.4 s without rows, the
  pane paints a message in its centre: a title, then a line naming what it is
  waiting on, with a seconds counter that ticks every 0.4 s. The counter is the
  part that matters — a message that never changes reads as a frozen
  application. The initial delay is what keeps fast local directories from
  flashing it.

The indicator is not Windows-only, but its `network://` wording is. On a
`network://` pane it reads:

```
Searching network shares…

Waiting for Windows to return the network browse list (14 s).
A machine that is switched off or unreachable can hold this up.
```

Every other scheme — and therefore everything on macOS and Linux — gets the
generic form:

```
Loading…

Still reading this folder (2 s).
```

`network://` cannot occur on macOS or Linux at all: `NetworkFileSystem` is
imported under the `PLATFORM == 'Windows'` gate in `core/fs/local/__init__.py`,
and both places that mint such a URL — `DrivesFileSystem.resolve` and the
UNC-server bounce in `LocalFileSystem.resolve` — sit behind the same gate. An
SMB share mounted there is an ordinary `file://` path (`/Volumes/...`,
`/mnt/...`, gvfs), so a slow one gets the generic message. Of the two speed
fixes above, row streaming is platform-independent; the browse-list pruning is
Windows-only because that code is.

## Known remaining slow paths

Neither freezes the UI, but both are worth knowing about:

- `LocalFileSystem.iterdir` uses `os.listdir` and then stats each entry
  separately — N round trips where `os.scandir` would need one. Not changed
  because on Windows `DirEntry.stat()` reports `st_dev`/`st_ino` as `0`, and
  `_prepare_move` compares `st_dev` to choose between a cheap rename and a full
  copy; seeding the cache with zeros would break cross-volume moves.
- `GoToListener.on_path_changed` calls `os.path.isdir` over the entries of
  `Visited Paths.json` under a 0.01 s budget that is only checked *between*
  calls. Once a `\\tsclient\...` path is in that history, a path change in
  either pane can block on it.
- `LocalFileSystem.resolve` is uncached and expensive on UNC, but runs once per
  navigation rather than per file.

## Implementation

- `src/main/resources/base/Plugins/Core/core/commands/hidden_files.py` —
  `_hidden_file_filter(url)` reads `query(url, 'stat').st_file_attributes` on
  Windows and treats any `OSError` as "not hidden" (the file still shows).
- `src/main/resources/base/Plugins/Core/core/commands/window.py` —
  `ToggleNetworkIcons` is an `ApplicationCommand`, so it registers by MRO like
  every other command in the package; it writes `_NETWORK_ICONS_KEY` via
  `core/settings.py`'s `save_setting` (passing `None` to clear the key when
  returning to the default) and then calls `pane.reload()` on each pane —
  `Model.reload()` already clears the FS cache for that location, which is where
  the icons computed under the old setting are held.
- `src/main/python/fman/impl/model/model.py` — `Model._load_attempted` records
  the rows `_load_remaining_files(...)` has tried; `reload()` clears it.
- `src/main/python/fman/impl/model/icon_provider.py` — `get_icon(...)` splits
  into `_get_file_icon(...)` and `_get_generic_icon(...)`. The latter is the
  folder-icon / per-suffix surrogate path that already existed for non-`file://`
  schemes; UNC paths now reuse it. `_is_network_path(path)` checks
  `path.startswith('//')` — `splitscheme(...)` hands over the forward-slash
  form, so `\\server\share` arrives as `//server/share`.
  `_network_icons_enabled()` reads the setting through `fman.load_json`, which
  is memoised, so the per-file cost is a dict lookup. The key name is
  deliberately restated in both modules rather than shared: a common constant
  would make `fman.impl` depend on the bundled Core plugin.
- `src/main/resources/base/Plugins/Core/core/fs/local/windows/network.py` —
  `_iter_handle(...)` recurses only into names that are *not* UNC-prefixed
  (`\\name`, i.e. a server or a share).
  `already_visited` stays: it still guards container cycles.
- `src/main/python/fman/impl/model/model.py` — `_init(...)` collects a batch
  alongside `files` and hands it to the existing `_record_files(...)` /
  `RecordFiles` path every `_INIT_BATCH_SECS`. The final `_on_rows_inited(...)`
  still runs and is still authoritative: `set_rows(...)` is a full diff, so the
  intermediate inserts converge. `reload()` is deliberately not batched — it
  keeps the old rows on screen while it re-enumerates.
- `src/main/python/fman/impl/view/__init__.py` —
  `FileListView.set_loading(text)` plus a `drawText` in `paintEvent(...)`, drawn
  only while `rowCount() == 0`, so it disappears by itself once the first batch
  lands. The colour comes from `QPalette.Disabled`/`QPalette.Text`, so it follows
  the active theme without new QSS.
- `src/main/python/fman/impl/widgets.py` — `DirectoryPaneWidget` starts a
  repeating `QTimer` in `_on_location_changed(...)` and stops it in
  `_on_location_loaded(...)`, which also fires for an empty directory. Each tick
  re-renders `format_loading_message(...)` with the elapsed seconds, so the same
  interval serves as both the initial delay and the redraw rate. The error path
  needs nothing: `location_disappeared` navigates elsewhere, which produces a
  fresh `location_changed`.
- Tests:
  - `src/main/resources/base/Plugins/Core/core/tests/commands/test___init__.py`
    (`HiddenFileFilterTest` — hidden, not hidden, failing `stat`, and that a
    non-`file://` URL is never stat'ed)
  - `src/main/resources/base/Plugins/Core/core/tests/fs/test_network.py`
    (`NetworkFileSystemTest` — the root lists servers without opening one, and
    a server lists its shares without opening one). Windows-only; skipped
    elsewhere.
  - `src/unittest/python/fman_unittest/impl/model/test_model.py`
    (`LoadRemainingFilesTest` — an unloadable row is attempted once, and a
    reload retries it; `InitStreamsFilesTest` — a slow listing shows rows
    before it finishes, a fast one still commits only at the end)
  - `src/unittest/python/fman_unittest/impl/model/test_icon_provider.py`
    (`NetworkIconTest` — local files keep the shell icon, network files share
    one icon per suffix, and the setting restores the shell icon)
  - `src/unittest/python/fman_unittest/impl/test_widgets.py`
    (`FormatLoadingMessageTest` — the indicator carries whole elapsed seconds
    below its title)
