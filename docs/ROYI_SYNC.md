# Royi sync ledger

Which changes from the RoyiFileManager fork have been ported into this fork.
Maintained by the `royi-sync` skill (`.claude/skills/royi-sync/SKILL.md`).

Last reviewed: v0.15.0 (d2cd32b)

The two repositories share no git history, so nothing can be merged or
cherry-picked — every row is a manual re-implementation. Rows follow the
bullets of Royi's `CHANGELOG.md`, newest version first.

Status: `pending` (not looked at yet), `ported`, `skipped` (with reason).
