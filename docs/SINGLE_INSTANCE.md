# Single instance

By default fman runs as a **single instance**. Launching `fman` again while it is
already running does not open a second window — the running instance handles the
launch instead.

## Behavior

- `fman "C:\some\folder"` → the running fman comes to the front and opens the
  folder in the **active pane**.
- `fman "C:\some\file.txt"` → the running fman opens the file's parent folder in
  the active pane and places the cursor on the file.
- `fman` (no path) → the running fman window is simply raised/focused.
- Multiple paths (`fman "C:\a" "C:\b"`) → the first path opens in the active pane,
  the next in the other pane, and so on, matching the fresh-start behavior.

If no instance is running, fman starts normally.

## Disabling it

To allow multiple independent fman windows again, set `single_instance` to
`false` in the app settings file:

    <DataDirectory>/Local/Settings.json

```json
{
  "single_instance": false
}
```

The default is `true` (single instance on). Create the file if it does not exist.

## How it works

The first instance listens on a per-user local socket
(`QLocalServer`/`QLocalSocket`). A later launch connects to that socket, sends its
(absolute) path arguments as JSON, and exits. The primary instance receives the
message on its Qt event loop, raises its window, and opens the paths via the same
path-resolution logic used at startup (`SessionManager.open_path_in_pane`).

The socket name is derived from the fman data directory
(`fman-si-<hash>`), so different OS users and installs never collide. If the
socket cannot be created, fman logs a warning and just starts a normal instance —
IPC problems never block startup.
