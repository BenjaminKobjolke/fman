# Plugin API

How fman finds a plugin, what a plugin can extend, and the contracts each
extension point has to keep.

For installing, reloading and removing plugins - and what happens when two
of them ship a package of the same name - see
[`docs/PLUGINS.md`](PLUGINS.md).

Everything here is importable from `fman` (plus its sibling modules
`fman.fs`, `fman.url`, `fman.clipboard`). Anything under `fman.impl` is
internal: it changes without notice.

## Where plugins live

| Directory | What goes there |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `<resources>/Plugins` | The shipped **Core** plugin. Loads first. |
| `%APPDATA%\fman\Plugins\Third-party` | Installed plugins. |
| `%APPDATA%\fman\Plugins\User` | Your own. `User\Settings` always loads **last**, so its JSON wins. |

On macOS and Linux, `%APPDATA%\fman` is
`~/Library/Application Support/fman` and `~/.config/fman`. The path is
`fman.DATA_DIRECTORY` (`FMAN_DATA_DIRECTORY` overrides it).

Load order is shipped → third-party → user (`impl/plugins/discover.py`). Each
plugin directory is appended to `sys.path`, so a plugin can `import` any other
loaded plugin's packages — including Core's.

## Plugin layout

```
%APPDATA%\fman\Plugins\User\My Plugin\
    my_plugin\__init__.py                  <- required: a package
    *.ttf                                  <- fonts, loaded automatically
    Theme.css        / Theme (Windows).css
    Key Bindings.json / Key Bindings (Windows).json
    File Context Menu.json / Folder Context Menu.json
    <anything>.json                        <- read with load_json('<anything>.json')
```

Only **directories containing `__init__.py`** are imported
(`impl/plugins/plugin.py`, `_load_packages`). Loose `.py` files at the plugin
root are ignored, and so is a nested package that nothing re-exports — see
[Registration](#registration).

A `(Windows)` / `(Mac)` / `(Linux)` suffix on any JSON or CSS filename makes it
platform-specific; `fman.PLATFORM` is the same token.

## Registration

fman does not have a `register_*()` call. It **scans the classes** reachable
from each package's `__init__.py` namespace and registers anything whose
ancestry includes one of these:

| Base class | Gives you |
|------------|-----------|
| `ApplicationCommand` | A command in the palette, bound to the window |
| `DirectoryPaneCommand` | A command bound to the pane it ran from |
| `DirectoryPaneListener` | Callbacks for pane events |
| `fman.fs.FileSystem` | A new url scheme |
| `fman.fs.Column` | A new file-list column |
| `Viewer` | A file viewer shown inside a pane — see [Viewers](#viewers) |

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Split your plugin across modules and you must re-export.** Only names
  reachable from `my_plugin/__init__.py` are scanned. Core does exactly this:
  `core/__init__.py` carries `from core.viewers import *` so the viewer classes
  in `core/viewers.py` are discovered.
- **Unloading is automatic.** Every registration pushes its own inverse action,
  which `fman.unload_plugin()` replays in reverse. Nothing you register leaks.

A command's name is its class name in snake_case: `CenterWindow` →
`center_window`. That is the name `Key Bindings.json` and `run_command()` use.

## Commands run off the main thread

Commands and listeners run on a worker thread
(`impl/plugins/command_registry.py`). **Any Qt call must be wrapped**:

```python
from fman.impl.util.qt.thread import run_in_main_thread

class ShowSomething(DirectoryPaneCommand):
	@run_in_main_thread
	def __call__(self):
		...   # safe to touch widgets here
```

`fman.impl.util.qt.thread` is technically internal, but it is imported by a
dozen Core modules and is the sanctioned way to do this.

Exceptions inside a command are caught and reported rather than crashing fman.

## Panes

You receive a `DirectoryPane`; you never construct one. `self.pane` in a
`DirectoryPaneCommand`, `pane.window.get_panes()` for all of them. Panes are
addressed **by index** into that list — key bindings pass `pane_index`. The
"other pane" idiom is:

```python
panes = pane.window.get_panes()
other = panes[(panes.index(pane) + 1) % len(panes)]
```

There are two panes by default, but the count comes from the saved session, so
never assume exactly two.

Location and selection: `get_path()`, `set_path(url, callback, onerror)`,
`reload()`, `get_selected_files()`, `get_file_under_cursor()`,
`place_cursor_at(url)`, `select()` / `deselect()`, `focus()`,
`get_columns()`, `get_sort_column()` / `set_sort_column()`.

## Putting your own widget in a pane

A pane can show **any `QWidget`** in place of its file list. This is what the
built-in file viewers are built on, and it is available to plugins directly —
your widget does not have to have a file behind it.

| Method | Does |
|--------|------|
| `pane.mount_widget(view, focus=True)` | Hides the file list, shows `view`, re-points the pane's focus proxy at it |
| `pane.unmount_widget()` | Removes and deletes it, restores the file list and its focus |
| `pane.get_mounted_widget()` | The mounted widget, or `None` |
| `pane.get_colors()` | `(background, foreground)` as hex, from the pane's live palette |

```python
from fman import DirectoryPaneCommand
from fman.impl.util.qt.thread import run_in_main_thread
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QLabel

class ShowHello(DirectoryPaneCommand):
	@run_in_main_thread
	def __call__(self):
		bg, fg = self.pane.get_colors()
		label = QLabel('hello')
		label.setStyleSheet(
			'QLabel { background-color: %s; color: %s; }' % (bg, fg)
		)
		self.pane.mount_widget(label)
```

Four things your widget owns once it is mounted:

- **Closing.** Nothing closes it for you. Handle `Escape` / `Enter` /
  `Backspace` in `keyPressEvent` and call `pane.unmount_widget()` — that is the
  contract users expect from the built-in viewers.
- **Pane switching.** `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` should run
  `pane.run_command('switch_panes')`. The focus proxy is already re-pointed, so
  tabbing back returns to your widget rather than the hidden file list.
- **Colors.** Use `get_colors()`. Hardcoding a palette means your widget is the
  one thing that ignores the user's theme.
- **Stylesheets.** Set colors with a **type-selector** rule
  (`QLabel { ... }`), never `*`. Core's `Theme.css` applies an app-wide
  `* { font-size: ...pt; }`, and once that touches a widget Qt switches it to
  the QSS style engine and stops honouring its palette. A local type rule beats
  the wildcard; a palette alone loses to it.

`focus=False` mounts without taking keyboard focus — for mounting into the
*other* pane while the user keeps browsing in this one.

## Viewers

A `Viewer` is a widget-in-a-pane that fman picks **for you**, by file, when the
user runs "View file". Subclass it and your viewer joins the built-in text,
image and video ones on equal footing — the viewer palette, next/previous-file
navigation and the per-viewer "advance only for same type" toggle all work
without further wiring.

```python
from fman import Viewer

class MarkdownViewer(Viewer):

	name = 'markdown'

	def matches(self, url):
		return url.lower().endswith('.md')

	def show(self, pane, url, focus_view=True):
		pane.mount_widget(build_my_widget(url), focus=focus_view)
```

| Member | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `name` | **Required**, unique, stable. Also the navigation category and the key its settings are stored under (`<name>_viewer_advance_same_type` in `Core Settings.json`), so renaming it silently resets those. A viewer without a name is refused, with an error. |
| `priority` | Higher wins when two viewers match. Default `0`. |
| `matches(url)` | `True` if you handle this file. Called during directory scans too, so keep it cheap. |
| `show(pane, url, focus_view=True)` | Build the widget and mount it. Forward `focus_view` to `mount_widget`. |

### Priority, and why it exists

Registration order is plugin load order, and Core loads first. Core's text
viewer *sniffs* rather than matching an extension, so it says yes to any file
that is not an image, a video or a binary — including your `.md`. It therefore
sits at **`priority = -100`**, below the default, so plugin viewers get first
refusal. Leave `priority` alone unless you are deliberately overriding another
plugin.

### What fman guards for you

- A viewer whose `matches()` raises is **skipped**, not fatal: the error is
  reported and the next viewer is tried. One broken plugin cannot take "View
  file" down.
- Directories and non-local urls never reach a viewer — "View file" alerts on
  those instead (`core/viewers.py`, `viewer_for`).
- Unloading the plugin unregisters the viewer.

`fman.find_viewer(url)` returns the viewer that would handle a url, or `None`;
`fman.viewer_for_category(name)` looks one up by `name`. You rarely need
either — they exist for code that has to ask the question without opening
anything.

See [File viewers](viewers/FILE_VIEWERS.md) for the user-facing behaviour your
viewer inherits, and [Key bindings](KEYBINDINGS.md#viewer-specific-bindings)
for the viewer-scoped binding file.

## Settings and other JSON

`load_json('My Settings.json', default={})` merges that filename across
**every** plugin directory in load order — dicts update, lists prepend — so a
user file overrides yours. `save_json` writes only the difference, into
`User\Settings`.

Core exposes the one-key convenience both it and its viewers use:

```python
from core.settings import get_setting, save_setting
save_setting('My Settings.json', 'key', value)   # value=None clears the key
```

## Fonts

Any `*.ttf` in a plugin's root directory is loaded into Qt's font database when
the plugin loads, and unloaded with it. Reference it by the family name in the
font's own name table — not the filename. It also becomes selectable as the UI
font; see [Fonts](FONTS.md).

## Dialogs and progress

`show_alert`, `show_prompt`, `show_status_message`, `clear_status_message`,
`show_file_open_dialog`, `show_quicksearch` (with `QuicksearchItem`), and
`submit_task(Task(...))` for anything long enough to need a progress dialog.
