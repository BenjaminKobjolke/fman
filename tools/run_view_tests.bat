REM Run the file list view's row height tests (UniformRowHeights keeping the
REM Fixed vertical header in step with its row height).
REM Excluded from `python build.py test` - hence the *_test.py name, which its
REM discovery does not match - because they need a QApplication of their own
REM and leftover Qt state is what makes that suite hang. See CLAUDE.md.
REM Offscreen, so no window appears.
