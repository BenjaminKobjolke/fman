REM Publish (or re-publish) the GitHub Release of a completed build.
REM Usage: github_release.bat [label]
REM   label  <version>_<build> of the installer in target\. Default: the label
REM          build_release.bat recorded in target\release_version.txt. Pass it only
REM          for an installer that was built before that record existed.
REM release_create.bat normally publishes by itself (its GitHub Release gate). This
REM is the retry path: it neither rebuilds nor bumps anything, and never reads the
REM current source version - that may have moved on since the build.
REM Requires the gh CLI, authenticated once via `gh auth login`. Idempotent: a
REM re-run re-uploads the asset (--clobber).

REM gh creates a missing tag by itself - on the head of the remote default branch,
REM which is not the release commit while that is still unpushed.

echo Publishing %LABEL%
REM --repo is mandatory: cwd is release-tool's checkout, so gh would otherwise
REM infer release-tool's own remote instead of fman's.
REM The title mirrors title_format in release_create.ini - keep the two in sync.
