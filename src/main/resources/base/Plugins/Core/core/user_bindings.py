"""
Reads and writes the user's own key binding file - the one the in-palette
binding editor (core/binding_editor.py) edits.

Deliberately not fman's save_json: 'Key Bindings.json' is a JSON *list*, and
save_json writes it differentially (fman/impl/plugins/config.py), which can only
append to the front of the user's file - everything after it must still match
the shipped files verbatim. Removing a binding is impossible that way. Writing
the user file directly handles add, change and remove with one mechanism, and is
the same code for the viewer bindings, which have no shipped file at all.

Reading stays on fman.load_json, so what the editor shows is the merged,
effective view (shipped + platform + user) fman itself dispatches from.
