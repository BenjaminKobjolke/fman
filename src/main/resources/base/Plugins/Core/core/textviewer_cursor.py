"""
The text viewer's four cursor keys - Home/End jump to the top/bottom of the
file and PgUp/PgDown page - as viewer pseudo-commands, so they show up in the
viewer's palette and can be rebound like every other one. Injected into
PaneTextView as a collaborator, the same shape core/textviewer_search.py's
ViewerSearch uses (and for the same reason: core/textviewer.py has to stay
under the project's 300-line file cap).

The hardcoded defaults below only fire in view mode, like search's "/" and
n/N: while editing, Home/End have to keep Qt's line-start/line-end editing
semantics. The commands themselves stay bindable in both modes, so a user who
wants them while typing can bind e.g. Ctrl+Home to text_go_to_top.

Paging hands a synthesized key event to the base QPlainTextEdit rather than
moving the cursor itself: QTextCursor has no page-move operation, so Qt's own
paging is only reachable through that method.
