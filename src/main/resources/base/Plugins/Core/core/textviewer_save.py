"""
Writing the text viewer's buffer back to disk (core/textviewer.py: the Save
file / Save file as… palette entries). Split out of core/textviewer.py to stay
under the project's 300-line file cap.

Like core/textviewer_reload.py - its counterpart in the other direction -
these operate directly on the PaneTextView instance (`view`) passed in, since
saving is tied to that widget's private state (`_path`/`_url`) as much as to
its buffer.
