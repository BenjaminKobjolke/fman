"""
The two stand-ins every viewer test needs: a DirectoryPane with a cursor, and
the Core Settings.json get/save pair.

Not named test_*.py on purpose - tools/run_core_tests.bat discovers by that
pattern, and this module defines no tests. It exists because StubPane in
particular encodes a contract (Qt's moveCursor clamps at both ends, it does
not wrap) that core/viewer_navigation.py's advance() and
core/viewer_file_ops.py's delete_current() both rely on; a copy per test file
drifts from that the moment either changes.

	clamps at both ends, exactly like Qt's moveCursor (see
