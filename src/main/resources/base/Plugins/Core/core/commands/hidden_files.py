"""Showing and hiding dotfiles / hidden files in a directory pane.

"Toggle hidden files" flips the pane's filter; `InitHiddenFilesFilter`
installs it at startup because fman instantiates commands lazily and the
filter has to exist before the first pane is drawn. The per-pane choice
lives in 'Panes.json' so it survives a restart.
