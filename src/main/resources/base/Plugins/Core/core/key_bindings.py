"""
Looks up the shortcut(s) currently bound to a command in the merged,
effective key bindings (base + platform + user overrides, as returned by
fman.load_json('Key Bindings.json')) - i.e. whatever the user actually has
configured, not a hardcoded default. Shared by the global command palette
(hint display, core/commands/__init__.py) and the text viewer (matching
keystrokes against the user's configured zoom shortcuts, and showing hints
in its own palette, core/textviewer.py). Kept in its own module since
core/commands/__init__.py imports core/textviewer.py at module load - the
reverse import would be circular.
