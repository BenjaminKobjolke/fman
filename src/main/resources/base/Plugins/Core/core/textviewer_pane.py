"""
Pane-mounting glue for the text viewer (core/textviewer.py): the caret-fix
stylesheet and the unsaved-edit confirmation prompt. Split out of
core/textviewer.py to stay under the project's 300-line file cap — genuinely
separate from PaneTextView itself (the widget/editor behaviour) even though
both are Qt-touching.

The swapping itself now lives in the engine (fman/impl/view/pane_mount.py,
exposed as DirectoryPane.mount_widget/unmount_widget) so plugins can mount
their own widgets too. mount_view/close_view below are shims kept for the
callers — and any plugin — that already use them.

# Once the app-wide Theme.css ("* { font-size: ...pt; }", applied via
# QApplication.setStyleSheet) touches a widget, Qt switches that widget from
# palette-based rendering to the QSS style engine — and the QSS engine only
# draws the blinking text caret if `color`/`background-color` are set
# explicitly; otherwise it silently stops drawing it. This mirrors the same
# wildcard-rule problem the font-size feature works around for the file list
# (`FileListView { font-size: ...pt; }`, commands/__init__.py) — a local
# type-selector override wins over the global `*` rule. `bg`/`fg` are read
# from the live file view's palette (see begin_new_view) so the viewer
# always matches the pane colors, whatever theme set them. `font_size`, when
# given, is the viewer's own zoom override (see PaneTextView._apply_font_size)
# — folded into the same local rule so it likewise beats the wildcard `*` rule.

	when a second view replaces the currently open buffer. Also shared by
	non-text views (e.g. PaneImageView, core/imageviewer.py) that have no

	circuits before `document()` is ever called on them, so they always
