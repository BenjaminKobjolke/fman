"""
Font-size zoom for the text viewer (core/textviewer.py) - mirrors the pane
font-size feature (core/commands/pane_view.py: increase/decrease/reset pane
font size) but applies to the viewer's own QPlainTextEdit, persisted under
its own settings key so the two zoom levels are independent. Split out of
core/textviewer.py to stay under the project's 300-line file cap.

Deliberately decoupled from PyQt widget styling: callers pass an `apply_size`
callback (new size, or None to clear the override) rather than this module
touching stylesheets itself.
