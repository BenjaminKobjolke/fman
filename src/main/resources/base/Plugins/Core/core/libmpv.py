"""
Ensures the native libmpv-2.dll (required by python-mpv, see core/videoviewer.py)
is available on Windows, downloading and caching it on first use.

Not bundled in the repo: LGPL builds like this one may be redistributed, but
fetching from upstream on first use avoids shipping a ~30 MB binary in git and
keeps fman itself from redistributing it at all - same pattern apps use for
ffmpeg. macOS/Linux are expected to install mpv via the system package manager
(brew/apt), where the loader finds it without any of this.

Pinned to a specific LGPLv2.1+ build from zhongfly/mpv-winbuild (not the more
common shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake builds, which are GPL-2.0-or-later by
default) - verified by SHA-256 before use.

A %PATH% prepend (not os.add_dll_directory()) is what's needed: python-mpv
resolves the DLL itself via ctypes.util.find_library(), which on Windows
scans %PATH% for the file and hands CDLL the resulting absolute path -
add_dll_directory() is never consulted by that lookup. Confirmed end-to-end
during development: prepending %PATH% and then `import mpv` succeeds.

The download runs via fman's own Task/submit_task machinery (the same one
core/commands/ uses for copy/move/delete/rename), which gives a
real byte-accurate QProgressDialog for free and - just as importantly - is
designed to be driven from a background thread. ensure_libmpv_on_path() must
be called from show_video_viewer() *before* it hands off to the
@run_in_main_thread-wrapped Qt widget code, not from within it: fman already
runs each DirectoryPaneCommand's __call__ on its own background thread (see
PaneCommandRegistry._run_outside_main_thread), so calling this from there
keeps the Qt event loop free during the download instead of freezing the
whole app for its multi-second duration.
