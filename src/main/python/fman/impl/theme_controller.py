Applying a theme while fman is running.

fman.impl.themes owns the *data*: the color tokens, the six non-color keys
a theme file may carry, and the validators each of them answers to. This
module owns the *push* - resolving the user's choice against the theme's and
handing the result to the QApplication, the main window, the icon provider
and the Theme stylesheet engine. Split from themes.py so neither file has to
be read to understand the other. See docs/THEMES.md.
