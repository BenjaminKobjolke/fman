Icon sets: where the file list's icons come from.

DEFAULT_ICON_SET means "ask the OS" - the Windows shell, GTK or macOS icon
fman has always used. Any other name is a directory holding a manifest.json
mapping file names, extensions and folder names to icon names, plus an svg/
directory holding those icons. fman bundles one such set, Material; a user
may drop their own into %APPDATA%/fman/Icons/<Name>/.

Deliberately shaped like fman.impl.themes: same list_/load_ pair, same
"later dirs win" rule, and the same promise that a broken file costs you
that one set rather than fman's startup. Which set is active is a theme
property - see docs/THEMES.md.
