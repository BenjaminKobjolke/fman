"""The recordable demo scripts, keyed by ``--automation-demo <id>``.

Split out of ``demo.py`` so the player stays readable next to a registry that
grows with every recorded chapter. See ``docs/DEMOS.md`` for how to record
these and what each one is for.

Both panes are already positioned by the trailing paths on the command line
(``tools/create_media/run_fman_demo.bat``), so a script only drives the UI.
Three things every script here depends on:

- **Pane order.** ``core.Name.get_sort_value`` sorts directories first, then
  case-insensitively and naturally, so the seeded folder reads changelog.txt,
  config.json, data.csv, dummy.mp4, dummy_1..dummy_10.jpg, notes.md,
  readme.md, todo.txt - ``dummy.mp4`` before ``dummy_1.jpg`` because ``.``
  sorts before ``_``. Every ``Down`` count below is written against that.
- **Prompt timing.** ``Prompt`` selects its prefilled text only on its second
  ``paintEvent``, so every step that types into one waits >= 1.6 s first.
- **Return is only ever pressed** on a directory, on a ``.zip`` (which
  ``ArchiveOpenListener`` rewrites into "open directory"), or inside a
  dialog. Pressing it on a ``.jpg``/``.mp4`` would launch the Windows default
  application on top of the recording.
