"""
Color themes: the single source of truth for every color in fman's UI.

fman's look used to be spread over three places that could drift apart -
the hardcoded hex literals in resources/base/styles.qss, the QPalette built
in application_context.py, and the quicksearch item colors in
Plugins/Core/Theme.css. This module replaces all three with one flat map of
named color tokens:

  * styles.qss and Theme.css now contain `$token` placeholders which
    Theme (impl/theme.py) substitutes at load time and again on every theme
    switch.
  * build_palette(...) & co. derive the QPalette from the *same* tokens, so
    a theme cannot style the file list one way and the text viewer - which
    samples QPalette.Base - another.

A theme is one JSON file listing only the tokens it changes; everything else
falls back to DEFAULT_COLORS, which holds exactly the values fman shipped
before themes existed. That is what makes the default theme provably
identical to the old look: its file is empty.

Beside its colors a theme may carry five things that are not colors:
opacity, icon set, icon size, icon color and font family. They share one
read-and-validate path (_load_theme_value) and one precedence chain
(ThemeController._get), so a sixth is a key and a validator.

See docs/THEMES.md for the token reference and how to add a theme.
