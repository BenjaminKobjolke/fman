"""
Swapping a widget into a DirectoryPane in place of its (hidden) file list, and
taking it back out again. This is what the built-in file viewers are built on
(the Core plugin's core/textviewer.py, imageviewer.py, videoviewer.py), and
what DirectoryPane.mount_widget/unmount_widget expose to plugins so they can
put their own widget in a pane without a file behind it.

Lives here rather than in the Core plugin because it is engine behaviour: it
knows DirectoryPaneWidget's layout, its file view and its focus proxy. It
deliberately knows nothing about what is being mounted - a viewer's own
concerns (an unsaved-edit prompt, say) stay with that viewer.
