"""
Central web links shown to the user (browser opens, alert <a href=...>).

Fork maintainers: this is the single place to retarget branded links at your own
site. Edit the values here at build time. This is intentionally NOT a runtime
setting in userdata — the URLs are baked into the build.

Named ``links`` (not ``urls``) to avoid confusion with ``fman.url``, which does
URL path manipulation, not web links.
